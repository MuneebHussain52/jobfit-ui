        The Resume & Job Description Matching System is a web-based tool developed to assist job seekers in tailoring their resumes to specific job requirements. In today's competitive job market, many candidates struggle to identify whether their resume aligns with a given job posting. This system solves that problem by analyzing the uploaded resume and the job description, extracting relevant technical skills from both using Natural Language Processing (NLP), and comparing them intelligently.

      <p>
        What makes this project unique is the two-step approach: First, we use an NLP module to extract meaningful skills and technologies from resumes and job descriptions. Then, we apply a Machine Learning model trained on job-market data to identify skill gaps â€” predicting which skills the candidate is missing and should consider learning.
      </p>
  
      <p>
        The tool is designed for students, fresh graduates, and professionals who want quick, AI-based feedback on how well they meet the criteria of a job. It also helps them plan their upskilling based on actual demand from job postings. The frontend is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, while the backend (in development) will integrate Python-based NLP and ML models to power the skill analysis and feedback generation.
      </p>
  
      <p>
        This system not only supports smarter job applications but also builds confidence by showing users exactly what employers are looking for and how they can close the gap.
